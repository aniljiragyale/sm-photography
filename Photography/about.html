  <h2>üë§ About Me</h2>
 <p>
  Based in Malgaon, Sangli district, I have a deep-rooted passion for photography and specialize in capturing not just moments‚Äîbut emotions, stories, and connections that last a lifetime.

  <p>
    Whether it's a grand wedding, an intimate maternity shoot, a stylish modeling portfolio, or candid life moments, I bring a unique blend of creativity, professionalism, and attention to detail to every frame.

  <p>
    I believe great photography isn‚Äôt just about the camera‚Äîit's about understanding people, building trust, and creating a comfortable space where they can be themselves.

    My studio is equipped with modern lighting and high-end equipment to deliver consistent quality across indoor and outdoor shoots. I also offer personalized pre-shoot planning, location scouting, and custom editing to make every project truly yours.
